Maxence is a PhD student in Surgical and Interventional Engineering supervised by Prof Sebastien Ourselin, Prof Prokar Dasgupta, and Steven Bishop - Head of Research and Strategy at CMR surgical. His work focuses on surgical phase recognition from robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedures with data recorded from the DaVinci and Versius robots. The objective is to understand the surgical workflow, enhance team training and improve clinically relevant outcomes. 

In 2020, he obtained an MSc degree in Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning from the University of Surrey. His Master’s project centred on using convolutional neural networks to predict malignancy in breast cancer. In 2019, he received an MSc in Data Science and Advanced Analytics from the University NOVA of Lisbon. This led him to work as a Deep Learning Engineer in medical imaging at Radiomics based in Belgium. He then decided to return to the UK to specialize in Surgical Data Science at King’s College London.
